# AI Agent Instructions for Q-Ant Development

This document provides instructions for the AI agent assisting in the development of the "Q-Ant" game.

## Core Directive

Your primary goal is to follow the development plan outlined in `PLAN.md`. You must systematically work through the tasks, implementing the features as described.

## Task Management

1.  **Reference the Plan:** Before starting any work, consult `PLAN.md` to identify the next uncompleted task.
2.  **Announce Your Task:** State which task you are about to work on (e.g., "Now starting task 1.1: Create `index.html`...").
3.  **Implement the Feature:** Write the necessary code or perform the required action to complete the task.
4.  **Mark as Complete:** After successfully completing a task, you **must** edit the `PLAN.md` file. Locate the line corresponding to the completed task and change its checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.

### Example

If you have just finished creating the `index.html` file (task 1.1), you will modify `PLAN.md` as follows:

**Before:**
```markdown
- [ ] **1. Project Scaffolding**
    - [ ] 1.1. Create `index.html` to host the canvas.
    - [ ] 1.2. Create `style.css` for basic page and canvas styling.
```

**After:**
```markdown
- [ ] **1. Project Scaffolding**
    - [x] 1.1. Create `index.html` to host the canvas.
    - [ ] 1.2. Create `style.css` for basic page and canvas styling.
```

This process ensures a clear and up-to-date record of the project's progress. Adhere to this workflow strictly.
